# Retro Drive Sounds
This repo intends to conserve the sounds of old PC disk drives (floppies or hard disks). 
Started as a collaboration to 86Box for the disk drive noise sounds feature, who know if this might grow more. 

In the first batch, I have included the sounds of the Panasonic JU-475-5 running in a NuXTv2 (8088, NEC V20 CPU). 
Recorded with a TASCAM DR-05X in WAV 16 bit 48 KHz mono, then trimmed with Audacity. It includes all kind of sounds, from inserting a disk, closing the drive, to accessing the drive with no disk, with an unformatted disk, or formatting a disk in full. Of course, loading MS-DOS -several versions, etc.

Open to contribute.

Feel free to reuse these in other projects.
