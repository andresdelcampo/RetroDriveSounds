# Retro Drive Sounds
This repo intends to conserve the sounds of old PC disk drives (floppies or hard disks). 
Started as a collaboration to 86Box for the disk drive noise sounds feature, who know if this might grow more. 

Recorded with a TASCAM DR-05X in WAV 16 bit 48 KHz mono.

Drives included so far:

- Alps Electric Co Ltd, 3 1/2 1.44 MB, black color. I think its sounds are quite the standard of what I remember of the drives of the era at least, and quite clean. This one was obtained purchased second hand. Recorded in a 486 with AMI BIOS.

- Panasonic JU-256, 3 1/2 1.44 MB, black color. I am not as convinced as with the Alps Electric, but an alternative set of sounds that some people prefer. This one was obtained purchased second hand. Recorded in a 486 with AMI BIOS.

- Panasonic JU-475-5 (a 5 1/4 floppy disk drive, black color, new old stock from PolyPlay) running in a NuXTv2 (8088, NEC V20 CPU). 
Trimmed with Audacity. It includes all kind of sounds, from inserting a disk, closing the drive, to accessing the drive with no disk, with an unformatted disk, or formatting a disk in full. Of course, loading MS-DOS -several versions, etc.
Recorded in two sessions. The second one, only POSTs, in a 486 with AMI BIOS. 

- Teac FD-55GFR, a 5 1/4 white floppy disk drive. Unfortunately it would not read correctly the disks during the recording, so files are limited. Recorded in a 486 with AMI BIOS.

Open to contributions.

Feel free to reuse these in other projects.
